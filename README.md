# lev/lev-ui ("Leviathan UI")

Hey all, in case you're wondering, this thing is lev.  I think it originally stood for "Leviathan UI" 
or something, but I'm not certain, as I'm not the original author and I don't know who is.  **lev** 
provides the core Swing UI interface functionality for **SkyProc**, which is a custom patcher for Skyrim. 
As of right now, I'm not certain the source code for this repo even exists, but I was able to track 
down lev.jar somewhere on the Internet, and it turns out it actually worked after a little patching. 

This repo just houses that JAR and the gradle material I can use to publish the thing to GHP. 

I'm rebuilding SkyProc, and this repo will help with organizing the dependencies, and also simply in preserving 
the lev JAR, which is essential for SkyProc, and presently has no publicly available source code (to my knowledge).

*Cheers,*
